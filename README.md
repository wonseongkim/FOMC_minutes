## Description

The research was done as a fellow in the “Young Researchers Exchange Programme between South Korea and Switzerland” under the “South Korean-Swiss Science and Technology Programme”.

The dataset, named 'fomc_minutes-label.csv', comprises 1,350 sentences each labeled under one of three categories: 'growth', 'employment', and 'inflation'. These labels were meticulously assigned by a team of three graduate researchers, all males aged between 20 to 30 years, to facilitate the training of large language models. Our methodology for labeling involved reaching a consensus among the researchers; a sentence was labeled based on a sentiment only if at least two researchers agreed on the classification. In cases where no majority agreement was reached, the sentence was categorized under 'No majority found', which is eliminated in the dataset. This dataset was instrumental in fine-tuning FinBERT and served as a benchmark to assess the model's performance in interpreting complex financial texts.
